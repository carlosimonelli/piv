            <h3>Ventotene Integrated Project</h3>
            In 1998 the Government has carried out the working program of the
            <a href="http://www.enea.it" target="enea">National Conference about 
            Environment and Energy (ENEA)</a>;
            that devising plan activity has brought to the printing of the White 
            Book, and of the related CIPE, which is a complex of guiding lines that 
            are useful to bring the whole Italian system toward a global emissions 
            level and a quality of life that are the ones that were stated in pot-Kyoto 
            regulations.
            <p>
            The approach to that matters with an integrated methodology seems to be 
            an excellent criterion to gain environment compatible objectives such as 
            sustainable development:
            <p>
            <table>
               <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><b>*</b></td>

                     Integrated analysis of the needs of  the territory;

               <tr>

                     Integrated use, in time, of the whole complex of money founds, 
                     such as the ones that request nothing in change and the co-paid 
                     founds that are available from Regions, Town Councils, single Nations, 
                     European Community and private investors
                  </td>
               </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            Another very important point of this integrated approach is the involving  
            of local, national and external actors that work on the single territories, 
            who are able to successful implement what we said before.<br>
            This methodology, that goes toward the integration of the renewable energy 
            sources technology, has been widely developed and sustained, by the National 
            devising plans that brought to the printing of the White Book, by <br>
            <a href="http://www.ansaldo.it/Renewable" target="ansaldo">ENERIN - Consorzio 
            Ansaldo for Renewable Energies.</a>
            <p>
            Starting from this point of view, in March 1999, the Town Ventotene Council, 
            together with an expert people commission set up on purpose to work on Ventotene, 
            has stated for its own area a devising procedure that comes from National procedures 
            that are in force in Italy (Territorial Agreements, Area Contracts, P.R.U.S.S.T.), 
            the aim of that statement is to gain environment-energy objectives in coherence 
            with the commitment that the Italian Government has taken following the post-Kyoto 
            guiding lines.
            <p>
            The Town Council, after the developing, through the P.I.V. Commission, of a 
            pre-evaluation of the emergencies and of the problems existing in the area, has stated 
            the launch of the Piano Integrato Ventotene (P.I.V.), this has to be used has a planning 
            and attraction of public and private investor instrument, useful to bring the "Island System", 
            in a four year time, to zero environment impact: that means zero Co2 emissions.
            <p>
            The Town Council has indicated as formal starting date April, 19 ,1999, when the formal task 
            was given by the Council to the Commission.<br>
            The post-evaluations are to be made in a four year period of time.
